    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These pork baby back ribs are tender, and the meat falls right off the bone. Generally, people think of baby back ribs as a meal they would only order at a restaurant, but they are so easy to make at home — this recipe could not be more simple</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds pork baby back ribs</li>
        <li>aluminum foil</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>bottle barbecue sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut ribs into 4 equal portions</li>
        <li>Tear off 4 pieces of aluminum foil big enough to enclose each portion of ribs. Grease each piece of foil with cooking spray</li>
        <li>Brush ribs liberally with barbecue sauce; place each portion of ribs on a piece of foil. Wrap tightly and refrigerate for 8 hours to overnight</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 150 degrees C. Bake ribs wrapped tightly in foil in the preheated oven for 2 ½ hours. Remove ribs from foil and serve with more sauce, if desired</li>
    </ol>
